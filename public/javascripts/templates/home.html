							<h2>TinyMCE Thumbnail Gallery</h2>
							<p>I'm a big fan of plugins and open source software, but when something is not available I'll do it myself. TinyMCE Thumbnail Gallery is a WordPress plugin that easily allows the user to generate
								a simple gallery in a page or blog post. It's completely open source and has been downloaded over
								13,000 times. <a href="/projects/tinymce-thumbnail-gallery">Dive into</a> the Gallery</p>
