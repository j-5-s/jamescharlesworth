				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
				<div class="about-column">
					<p>Working at The Home Depot I write validations on product data in a server side JavaScript
						environment. Working with product data can get complicated fast and JavaScript is a great
						language for it with its dynamic typing and freedom of expression.</p>
					<p>I also have created a few Node.js apps that help make my job easier.  Node.js is extremely fast and forces you to write small and simple applications, which in my opionion are the best kind.</p>
					<p>As for frontend JavaScript, I stand on the shoulders of giants.  I am constantly making rich
						applications with jQuery, Backbone.js, Underscore and require.js. </p>

				<h2>SEO</h2>
				<div class="about-column">
					<p>I spent three years as an SEO analyst doing nothing but generating lots of valuable traffic to websites. I find that the best SEO campaigns consist of something tangible like great content or strong product knowledge that is well presented. </p>
					<p>SEO is a true passion of mine, however SEO alone is not enough. SEO should not be the goal of a campaign, it should be the power behind it. The goal is usually to increase revenue or leads and SEO is just one piece of the puzzle in doing that.</p>

				<h2>PHP</h2>
				<div class="about-column">
					<p>I've been writing PHP code for 7 years now.  Starting off as a small business owner creating my own
						custom PHP applications I have come a long way. I am Zend PHP 5.0 certified and enjoy working
						with PHP mainly because of all the great open source frameworks like Symfony and WordPress.</p>
					<p>I've built a majority of my applications and websites with PHP but am starting to lean towards
						Node.js for backend programming. I don't think there is a one size fit all approach though
						and consider all the variables.</p>

				<h2>Design</h2>
				<div class="about-column">
					<p>I enjoy creating simple web designs and nothing too complex. I find that any design that makes
						the content standout is usually a good one. I hand code all my HTML templates and work with
						CSS frameworks such as Compass and SASS along with Blueprint.</p>
					<p>I am the first to admit that design is not my strong suite so if you are looking for
						an amazing design i recommend you find someone else.  My sites and applications focus
						on data driven applications with a solid user experience.</p>
