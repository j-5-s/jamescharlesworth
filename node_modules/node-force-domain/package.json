  "readme": "# node-force-domain\n\nnode-force-domain is a middleware for the Connect and / or Express.js framework that allows you to have multiple domains, but forces them to redirect to a default one.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install node-force-domain\n\n## Quick Start\n\nUsing node-force-domain is easy. All you need to do is to register it within Express.js as middleware. Therefore, simply add the following line into your app.js file before all other calls to app.use(...):\n\n```javascript\napp.use(require('node-force-domain').redirect('www.example.com'));\n```\n\nBy default, a 301 (permanent) redirect is used, and any path / query string data is cleared. If you want to change this behavior, feel free to provide a configuration object:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(require('node-force-domain').redirect('www.example.com', {\n  type: 'permanent', // 'temporary' === 307\n  cutPath: true\n}));\n```\n\nIf you are running your Node.js based web application behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx, you have to forward the originally requested host:\n\n    server {\n      // ...\n\n      location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n      }\n    }\n\n\nPlease note that localhost is always being excluded from the redirection rule. Hence you can continue developing locally as you are used to.\n\nThat's it :-)!\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012 Golo Roden.\n \nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n \nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n \nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
